We shall not cease from exploration  
And the end of all our exploring  
Will be to arrive where we started  
And know the place for the first time.  

- T.S Eliot

### This is just to say
##### By Juan Carlos Williams

I have eaten  
the plums  
that were in  
the icebox  

and which  
you were probably  
saving  
for breakfast  

Forgive me  
they were delicious  
so sweet  
and so cold
